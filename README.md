#A Passion Driven Portfolio

The Passion Driven Portfolio showcases what a portfolio site for a **passion driven** professional might look like.

## Overview

I'm a full-time traveler & front-end developer that believes the key to living a passion driven lifestyle is a balance in work-life happiness. Want to know more? [Check out my portfolio](http://www.tylergoelz.com).

## Under The Hood (Core Features)
In order for you to follow your passion, you have to **G**et **Y**our **SHI**t **DO**ne. To [GYSHIDO](http://gyshido.com) with code, you need to work smarter.
To work smarter and so you can follow your passion, A Passion Driven Portfolio uses tools like...

* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) - Because, well, Angular is freakin' sweet.
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) - Set up the badass scaffolding for this project. Yeoman generators use best practices and tools for modern front-end apps.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - Used in this project to Sass to CSS, check for JS errors, live reloading, concatenating and minifying files, versioning assets, and generating lean Modernizr builds
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Keeps all of our packages in order
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
* [Angular directives for bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
    * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via Google CDN, with a local fallback
    * [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection, with lean builds with Grunt

* [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) - Makes sure the code we write is clean
* [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) - Nobody likes having to hit `cmd+r` every time they make a change
